# Environment Variables for Deployment

## Required Environment Variables

When deploying this application, you need to set the following environment variables:

### Frontend (Vite)
- `VITE_RUNPULSE_API_KEY` - Your RunPulse API key for document processing
- `VITE_OPENAI_FORMATTER_URL` - URL of the OpenAI formatting service

### Backend (Flask - OpenAI Formatter)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key for document formatting

## Vercel Deployment

For Vercel deployment, add these variables in your project settings:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add the following variables:

```
VITE_RUNPULSE_API_KEY=your_runpulse_api_key_here
VITE_OPENAI_FORMATTER_URL=your_openai_formatter_service_url
```

## Local Development

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
VITE_RUNPULSE_API_KEY=your_runpulse_api_key_here
VITE_OPENAI_FORMATTER_URL=http://localhost:5000/format-document
```

## Security Notes

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- The frontend will fallback to user-provided API keys if environment variables are not set
